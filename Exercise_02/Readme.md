# Using GitHub

Git is a distributed versionsing system originally developed to support open source software development, but now widely used and supported for managing distributed development, archiving, and sharing of code, models, data, etc. across a variety of programming languages and applications. GitHub.com is an online repository for Git where materials can be stored in public or private repositories. Membership to GitHub is free or through subscription. GitHub integrates seemlessly with RStudio and can be used to develop and save replicable code for running system dynamics simulations in R across a variety of platforms including local computers or laptops and hihg performance computing (HPC) clusters.
