# Replication Study

Replication is a hallmark of science, and a replication study is one where the primary goal is to replicate the results from a previous study. 

# Instructions

1. Start a session on the HPC OnDemand RStudio Server.
2. In RStudio, create and set the working directory to a folder where you want to clone the repository.
3. Switch to the terminal within RStudio and ckeck your current working directory using the "pwd" command.
4. Get the latest version of the SD-R-user-group repository from GitHub using the following command: `git clone https://github.com/CBSDLab/SD-R-user-group.git`. You should now see a folder for the SD-R-user-group repository:

5. Open the folder /SD-R-ser-group/Exercise_03 and set this as the working directory.
6. Open the "Study 1.Rmd" R Markdown file and run the script in chunks or by knitting the document to create a PDF report.
