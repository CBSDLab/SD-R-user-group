# Replication Studies

Replication is a hallmark of science, and a replication study is one where the primary goal is to replicate the results from a previous study. This exercise provides the R Markdown file, Stella simulation model, and associated files for replicating the simulation results in the Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review paper "System Dynamics of Cognitive Vulnerabilities and Family Support Among Latina Children and Adolescents". 

# Requirements

Completing this exercise requires access to the CWRU HPC and stella_simulator. With slight modifications to the paths and system command, the study can be replicated using Stella Architect on a local computer. 

# Instructions

1. Start a session on the HPC OnDemand RStudio Server.
2. In RStudio, create and set the working directory to a folder where you want to clone the repository.
3. Switch to the terminal within RStudio and ckeck your current working directory using the "pwd" command.
4. Get the latest version of the SD-R-user-group repository from GitHub using the following command: `git clone https://github.com/CBSDLab/SD-R-user-group.git`. You should now see a folder for the SD-R-user-group repository:

5. Open the folder /SD-R-ser-group/Exercise_03 and set this as the working directory. You should see the following files in the directory:

6. Open the "Study 1.Rmd" R Markdown file and run the script in chunks or by knitting the document to create a PDF report.
