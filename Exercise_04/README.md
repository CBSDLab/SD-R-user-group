# Policy Analysis with Sensitivity Analysis

One of the main reasons to develop a system dynamics simulation model is being able to analyze models to identify and rank intervention points. This can include a univariate analysis where one is considering each intervention alone, a multivariate analysis where one considers multiple interventions in combinations (or strategies), and a sensitivity analysis where one is not only considering the impact of one or more interventions on outcome variables of interest, but also how *sensitive* the outcomes are to uncertainties in the initial conditions and parameters of a model. 

This exercise uses the Systems Change fOr Racial Equity (SCORE) system dynamics simulation model version 1-5 developed in Stella Architect as part of teh Cross Sector Innovations Initiative (CSII) project (Heidi Gullet, PI).
