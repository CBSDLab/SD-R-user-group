# SD R user group 
The system dynamics (SD) R user group is a collection of code examples for developing, simulating, testing, calibrating and analyzing system dynamics models using R on CWRU high performance computing (HPC) cluster. This collection is organized as a set folders containing with exercise. Each exercise is self-contained. 

1. ***Exercise 01-Getting started.*** This exercise provides a basic introduction on using RStudio to run Stella models on the CWRU HPC using Stella Simulator. 
2. ***Exercise 02-Using GitHub.*** This exercise provides a basic introduction to using GitHub and cloning the SD-R-user-group repository in the user's home directory on the the HPC. Cloning the SD-R-user-group is the easiest way to access the latest version of the GitHub repository. 
3. ***Exercise 03-Replicating a simulation study.*** This exercise introduces and demonstrates the replication of a simulation study in R. 
4. ***Exercise 04-Running a policy analysis.*** This exercise introduces the design and simulation of a policy analysis combined with a sensitivity analysis, and plotting the results using box and whisker plots.
